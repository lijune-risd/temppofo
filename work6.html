            <h2>2022 South Korean Election</h2>
            <h3>NYT Interactive Inspired Website</h3>
            <p> 2022 South Korean Election website is a website that I have created for CTC Artist Report.
                The CTC Artist Report focused on creating interactive experiences in a way 
                that can be presentable to newspapers or magazines. The class invited guest editors 
                and journalists that would help impact and create this website. 
                The website focuses on the demographic breakdown of the 2022 South Korean election. 
            </p>

  

            <h4>Process</h4><hr style ="margin-bottom:20px;">
            <p style = "line-height: 2rem;  ">
                I first created a page with HTML CSS after I prototyped it with Figma. 
                The demographic was split into three divisions: age, gender, and region. 
                The speech bubbles are the certain language used during the election. 
                The language aspect was meant to differentiate it from the different demographic
                pages. Specifically in the election 2022, internet language affected the way 
                and swayed the results.  
            </p>
            <video width="100%" controls autoplay>
                <source src="./assets/images/other/other11.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video> 
            <p style = "line-height: 2rem; margin-top:4rem;">
                This would be the diagram page of the website that is inspired by the NYT layout. 
                You could see some of the digital coding skecthes I created (that repeated text) to recreate 
                the candidates' faces. 
            </p>

            <video width="100%" controls autoplay>
                <source src="./assets/images/other/other12.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>   
            <p style = "line-height: 2rem; margin-top:4rem;">
                This would be a pop-up page that would create an interactive experience for each
                division (all having some relation to language)
            </p>

            <video width="100%" controls autoplay>
                <source src="./assets/images/other/other10.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>    

            <h4 style = "font-size: 2rem;"> Problems </h4>
            <p> After some user testing, I have collected the following criticism
            </p>
            <p style = " margin-left: 2rem; line-height: 2rem">
                1. Experience can be tied to one page <br>
                2. Shorten the experience to its essential <br>
            </p>


            <h4 style = "font-size: 2rem;"> Next Step </h4>

            <p> With these criticisms in mind, I recreated the page with HTML/CSS/JS to tie 
                the experiences to a single page and a continuous line that ties the narrative together. 
            </p>

            <video width="100%" controls autoplay>
                <source src="./assets/images/other/other5.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>

            <h4 style = "font-size: 2rem;"> Reflection </h4>

            <p> I learned to create a narrative webpage in an unique interactive manner. 
            </p>
